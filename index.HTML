      <section id="history" class="card-header text-center"><b>History of Freestyle</b></section>
      <p class="text-monospace text-center">
          Freestyling was popularized in the 1980s. There are two types of freestyle. 
          There's an old-school freestyle that's basically rhymes that you've written 
          that may not have anything to do with any subject 
          or that goes all over the place. 
          Then there's freestyle where you come off the top of the head.
          Freestyling is known as the term as "going off the top" or "off the dome". 
          The most-well known freestylers are Eminem, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, JuiceWRLD, and Proof.

      <br>
      <p class="text-monospace text-center">Now that you have the history of the art of freestyling, 
          I will introduce you to the steps that have helped me so far. 
          I been working on it for at least two months, and I have made good process.
          Now, these steps are ways that help me with my process. Hopefully it can help you as well.

    <section id="Step-1" class="card-header text-center"><b>Step 1: Listen to mutiple beats</b></section>
        <p class="text-monospace text-center">
            The first thing that you should do is listen to multiple beats,
            so you can work on your "flows" or the way you deliver a line.
            Having multiple knowledge on how a beat goes can help you be constent in your freestyles.
            You can also listen to the beat and think of a topic or word you want to start off with and go from there. 
            For example, let's say you are listening to a beat that has a beat with big 808 bass drops and snares and hi hats, 
            just listen to the pattern that the beat follows and start setting up for the next step.
        </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <section id="Step-2" class= "card-header text-center"><b>Step 2: Write words that come to your mind.</b></section>
        <p class="text-monospace text-center">
            After listening to different beats, ideas will come to your mind and you will want to write 
            the way you want to get on the beat. 
            you can make lines or you can jolt down single words that you want to end each line.
            I personally jolt down single words and make up the majority of my lines. 
            this will help you memorize words and the single word method is helpful if 
            you want to think about different lines that will use that line.
            For example, Let's say the word is "bank", you can say a line like:
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>I'll be laughing to the bank,
                in my bentley tank
            </i>
            <br>
            <br>
            you can use the same words but different concepts:
            <i>I got this cash on me like the bank,
                I got a mercedes-benz truck and it looks like a tank
            </i>
            <br>
            <br>
            Jolting down lines or single words will benefit you on remembering words.

    <section id="Step-3" class="card-header text-center"><b>Step 3: Download RhymeBlock</b></section>
        <p class="text-monospace text-center">
            RhymeBlock is a mobile app that works like Apple's Notes. However, on RhymeBlock, 
            everytime you type a word it will give you suggestions on a word that rhymes with that certain word.
            This app has been very helpful for me since my vocabulary is not really advanced, and 
            I have trouble trying to find words that will rhyme with each other.
        </p>

    <br>   
    <section id="Step-4" class="card-header text-center"><b>Step 4: Practice with friends</b></section>
        <p class="text-monospace text-center">
            Practicing with friends will help you as well. Having a person saying a couple of lines and having 
            you picking up where they left will help your consistency of delivering lines on the spot. Your friend doesn't have to be the best 
            freestyler, just a person that you can bounce words off of will benefit you and your friend. I did this with a friend I met,
            and we continue to do it daily to help ourselves on consistency. 
        </p>

    <section  id="Step-5" class="card-header text-center"><b>Step 5: Practice makes perfect</b></section>
        <p class="text-monospace text-center">
            I know, it sounds clich√©. However, it will not come easy to you if you do not work at it.
            I am been working on for about two months like I said. However, I am constantly practice my flows and vocabulary.
            Work constantly by yourself or with a friend. It will take a little bit of effort to be really good at this skills.
